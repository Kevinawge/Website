# Kevin Hernandez - Data Analyst Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my background, skills, and data analytics projects. It includes sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, with live links to my work in areas such as forecasting, SQL analysis, and business intelligence. The site is fully responsive and designed from scratch without any external frameworks.

Each project card links directly to a GitHub repository, and the contact form is powered by FormSubmit to allow direct email submissions. This portfolio highlights my technical proficiency in tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, and reflects the work I've done academically and professionally.
